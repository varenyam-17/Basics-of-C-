# Basics of c++
AIM-Hello World and Calculator program

Theory:
•	The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is needed.

•	The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.

•	The next line '// main() is where program execution begins.' is a single-line comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of the line.

•	The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.

•	The next line cout << "Hello World"; causes the message "Hello World" to be displayed on the screen.

•	The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.
TOOls USED:
- #include <iostream>: Includes the input-output stream library for using cin and cout.
- 
-using namespace std;: Allows access to the standard namespace, simplifying code syntax.
-
-  // (Single-line comment): Used to annotate code for clarity; ignored during execution.
-
- int main(): Entry point of the program where execution begins.
-
- cout << "Hello World";: Outputs the string to the console.
-
- return 0;: Ends the main() function and returns control to the operating system.
Conclusion

The Hello World program successfully demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program, including headers, namespaces, comments, and output statements. The calculator extension further reinforces understanding of input/output, arithmetic operations, and control flow. This foundational exercise builds confidence in writing and debugging simple C++ programs.
